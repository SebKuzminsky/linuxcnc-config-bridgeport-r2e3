control panel:

    Spindle:

        If you push the spindle On/Off button on the control panel when the
        spindle is running, turn the spindle off.

        If you push the Spindle On/Off button when the spindle is off, consult
        the Spindle Faster/Slower knob to select cw/ccw spindle rotation.

    Use the jog axis selector to route the cont-jog-plus/cont-jog-minus
    buttons to the correct axis?

    Use another setting on the jog axis selector rotary to route the
    jogwheel to continuous-jog-speed adjust?
