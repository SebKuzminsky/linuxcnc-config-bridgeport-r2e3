This configuration drives a particular Bridgeport Series 1 R2E3, converted
from the factory Boss8 controller to EMC2 2.4 by Chris Radek and Sebastian
Kuzminsky in the spring of 2010.

The Bridgeport has the original Contraves NC400 servo amps, the original
servos, limit & home switches, and spindle.

It is driven by emc2 via a Mesa AnyIO board (5i22 in this case, though
any AnyIO board should work), a Mesa 7i48 servo controller, and two Mesa
7i37 opto-isolated I/O boards.

This config is based on the "hm2-servo" config originally written by
Ted Hyde.  This config differs from Ted's in the following ways:

    * it includes a properly integrated e-stop chain (via ClassicLadder)

    * includes proper limit & home switches

    * includes support for a VFD (GS2-23P0 from Automation Direct)
      to power the spindle motor

    * includes support for open-loop spindle speed control (using a
      stepper to turn the Varispeed control, but lacking speed feedback
      to emc2)

    * includes support for the jogwheel on the original Boss8 control
      panel

    * includes support for manual tool changer

    * includes support for a Logitech "RumblePad" cheesy-pendant (with
      thanks to John Thornton, Ed Nisley, and Rick G)
